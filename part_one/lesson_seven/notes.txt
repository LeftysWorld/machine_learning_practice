look at daily portfolio values - NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS

cumulative return
average daily return
risk
sharpe ratio


build a function that can do this automatically.








Daily Portfolio Value:

start_val = 1000000
sd, ed = "01-01-2009", "12-31-2011"
symbols = ["SPY", "XOM", "GOOG", "GLD"]
allocs = [0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1]

Question:
    - How do we calculate the total vlue of the portfolio day by day?


STEP BY STEP:

1)  Start with prices dataframe.
                     SPY       XOM      GOOG       GLD
    2009-01-02  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000
    2009-01-05  0.998848  0.999866  1.020945  0.979705
    2009-01-06  1.005530  0.983620  1.039649  0.987243

2)  Normalize these prices: normed =    prices / prices[0]

3)  After we normalize #1 we get a new dataframe, df_normed

4)  Multiply the normed values with the allocations to each of the equities:    alloced = normed * allocs

5)  After we multiply df_normed with the alloc (#4) we get a new dataframe, df_alloced

6)  Multiply df_alloced with the starting value ($1m):  position_values = alloced * start_val

7)  After we multiply the alloced with the starting value we get a new dataframe, df_pos_vals

8)  Now that we have the value each day for the individual asset, we can calculate the total value for the portfolio each day by summing accross each day:  port-val = pos_vals.sum(axis=1)

9) We now have port_val which is a df of only one column: the portfolio value each day.
