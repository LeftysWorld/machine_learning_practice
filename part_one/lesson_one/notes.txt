This lesson went over these things:
    - how to open and read a csv file (can do)
    - how to get the max close, the mean volume from a stock csv file (can do)
    - how to select rows with panda in a csv file (can do)
    - how to plot high prices from a stock csv file (can do)
    - how to plot two columns from a csv file (can do)


    Open and Read a CSV file:
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("{}{}".format(PATH, symbol)
        print df

    Select Rows in a csv file (splicing):
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("{}{}".format(PATH, symbol)
        print df[:7]

    Get Max Close from CSV file:
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("{}{}".format(PATH, symbol)
        get_max = df["Close"].max()
        print get_max

    Plot Columns from CSV file:
        import pandas as pd
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        df = pd.read_csv("{}{}".format(PATH, symbol)
        symbollist = ["High", "Close", "Adj Close"]
        df[symbollist].plot()
        plt.show()

This lesson I learned myself:
    - how to parse all the files in a directory
    - merge two or more dictionaries with reduce

    Parse files from directory:
        from os import listdir
        from os.path import isfile, join
        return [f for f in listdir(PATH) if isfile(join(PATH, f))]

    Dictionary Merge:
    d1, d2 = {"a": "aa"}, {"b": "bb"}
    return reduce(lambda x,y: dict(x, **y), (d1, d2))



This lesson I want to learn:
    - how to parse only the file names in a directory
